### Why thread is not better 

Thread usually takes up more space. Usually it takes around 2mb in OS. And it depends on the system about how much thread it can create. 

### Context switiching
context switching is also hard. Context switching is you want to  do some work in the main thread and some work in background thread. But in case of thread its hard to do.
